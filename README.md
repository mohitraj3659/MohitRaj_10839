# MohitRaj_10839
Palindrome number checker
🎯 Objective of the Project

The objective of this project is:

To understand the basic concepts of C programming

To work with loops, conditional statements, and variables

To implement a simple logic-based program



🛠️ Tools and Technologies Used

Programming Language: C

Compiler: GCC / Turbo C / Any C Compiler

Platform: Console-based application




💡 How the Project Works

The user enters a number.

The program reverses the number using a loop.

The reversed number is compared with the original number.

If both are the same, the number is a palindrome.

Otherwise, it is not a palindrome.




✅ Why This Project Is Useful

Helps beginners understand number manipulation

Improves logical thinking

Strengthens knowledge of loops and conditionals

Acts as a foundation project for learning C programming




📈 Importance of This Project

This project matters because:

It is a basic but important problem in programming

Many real-world problems require similar logic

It builds confidence for solving more complex programs

It helps in understanding how algorithms work step by step




⚠️ Difficulties Faced While Making the Project

While working on this project, I faced some difficulties such as:

Understanding how to reverse a number

Managing variables correctly

Using loops properly without errors

Debugging logical mistakes in the code

These challenges helped me improve my problem-solving skills.




📚 Learning Outcomes

From this project, I learned:

How to use while/for loops effectively

How to apply if-else conditions

How to work with integer operations

How to think logically and break a problem into steps

Basic debugging skills in C
